This README_UML.txt file is a guide to understanding some of the notation presented in the UML Class Diagram.

Half arrows are used in order to reduce the number of lines connecting aggregate and component classes.
If an arrow is pointing towards a line, it means that the component goes along with another component which both lead to an aggregate class.
